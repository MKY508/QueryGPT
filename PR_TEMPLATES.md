# QueryGPT PR 提交模板

## 模板 1：提交到 awesome-ai-agents

### Fork 后编辑位置
在 README.md 中找到合适的分类（如 "Data Analysis Agents" 或 "Code Execution Agents"），按字母顺序插入。

### 添加内容
```markdown
- **QueryGPT** - Turn database conversations into insights. Built on OpenInterpreter, it understands what you need - whether that's a quick SQL query or complex Python analysis. Been using it for 3 months now, saved our team countless hours on repetitive reports. Handles Chinese queries perfectly too, which is rare. [[GitHub](https://github.com/MKY508/QueryGPT)]
```

### PR 信息
**Title:** Add QueryGPT - Data analysis agent with natural language interface

**Description:**
```
Hi there! 

Adding QueryGPT to the list. It's been incredibly useful for our team's data work.

What makes it stand out:
- Uses OpenInterpreter under the hood, so it's not limited to just SQL
- Handles both structured queries and complex analysis tasks
- Solid Chinese language support (hard to find in this space)
- Actually deployed in production, handling real business queries daily

It fits well in the data/analytics agents category. The project is actively maintained and has good documentation for getting started.

Let me know if you need any additional info!

## 模板 2：提交到 Awesome-Text2SQL

### 添加位置
在 "Open Source Text2SQL Tools" 或类似section。

### 添加内容
```markdown
### QueryGPT
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/MKY508/QueryGPT
- **Description**: More than text-to-SQL - it's an intelligent data assistant. Leverages OpenInterpreter to dynamically choose between SQL and Python based on query complexity. Particularly good with business queries like "show me last month's top performing products" - it understands context and generates both queries and visualizations.
- **Features**: 
  - Natural language to SQL/Python
  - Auto-visualization 
  - Chinese & English support
  - Session memory for follow-up questions
  - Export to multiple formats
- **Database Support**: MySQL, PostgreSQL (via OpenInterpreter)
```

### PR 信息
**Title:** Add QueryGPT - Context-aware text-to-SQL with Python fallback

**Description:**
```
Hey team,

I'd like to add QueryGPT to the list. While there are many text-to-SQL tools, QueryGPT takes a different approach that I think adds value to this collection.

Key differentiators:
1. It doesn't just generate SQL - it executes it and returns formatted results
2. For complex queries that SQL can't handle well, it automatically uses Python (via OpenInterpreter)
3. Maintains conversation context, so you can ask follow-up questions naturally
4. Generates visualizations without being asked when it makes sense

We've been running it in production for a few months. It's particularly helpful for business users who know what they want but not how to write SQL.

The project is open source (MIT) and actively maintained. Happy to answer any questions!
```

## 模板 3：提交到 awesome-ChatGPT-repositories

### 添加内容
```markdown
- [QueryGPT](https://github.com/MKY508/QueryGPT) - Brings ChatGPT-style interaction to your database. Powered by OpenInterpreter, it doesn't just generate code - it runs it and shows you the results. Perfect for teams who want ChatGPT's ease of use for data analysis. Supports complex multi-step analysis that would normally require a data scientist.
```

### PR 信息
**Title:** Add QueryGPT - ChatGPT for database queries and analysis

**Description:**
```
Hi!

Suggesting QueryGPT for inclusion. It extends the ChatGPT paradigm to database interactions in a practical way.

Why it's relevant to this list:
- Implements conversational AI for a specific domain (data analysis)
- Uses similar interaction patterns to ChatGPT but with code execution
- Based on OpenInterpreter, which itself builds on the ChatGPT code interpreter concept
- Makes advanced data analysis accessible to non-programmers

The tool has been battle-tested in production environments. It's particularly useful for teams that want ChatGPT-like simplicity for their data needs.

Thanks for maintaining this awesome list!

## 模板 4：提交到 awesome-datascience

### 添加内容
```markdown
#### QueryGPT
Natural language interface for data analysis. Ask questions in plain English (or Chinese), get back SQL queries, Python analysis, and visualizations. Built on OpenInterpreter, it bridges the gap between business questions and technical implementation. Great for exploratory data analysis and automated reporting.

## 通用提交技巧

### 个性化每个 PR
不要复制粘贴同样的描述。每个列表的维护者都希望看到你了解他们的项目。花几分钟：
1. 看看列表的其他项目是怎么描述的
2. 了解这个列表的重点（比如是偏技术还是偏应用）
3. 调整你的描述来匹配这个风格

### 时机选择
- 最佳提交时间：周二到周四（维护者比较活跃）
- 避免周末和周一（积压太多 PR）
- 如果2周没响应，可以友好地 ping 一下

### 互动建议
如果维护者提出修改建议：
```
Thanks for the feedback! You're absolutely right about [specific point]. 
I've updated the description to [specific change]. 
Does this look better?
```

如果被拒绝：
```
No problem, thanks for taking the time to review! 
If you have any suggestions on how the project could better fit the list in the future, I'd love to hear them.
```

## 实战建议

1. **先易后难**：先提交到小一点、更专业的列表，积累一些成功案例
2. **观察格式**：有些列表要求 emoji，有些不要；有些要详细描述，有些要简洁
3. **展示差异**：不要说"又一个 text-to-SQL 工具"，要说明你的独特之处
4. **提供证据**：如果可能，提供使用数据（用户数、查询量、GitHub stars等）
5. **保持谦逊**：不要过度宣传，让功能自己说话

记住：维护者都是志愿者，尊重他们的时间和决定。即使被拒绝，也要保持礼貌和专业。
